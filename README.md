This is an opinionated fork of [Arturo's PTCGPB](https://github.com/Arturo-1212/PTCGPB) optimized for group rerolling scenarios, everything unrelated for group rerolling are either removed or untouched.

## **__What's New?__** 🚀

- 🔧 Improved frozen/stuck instance handling in Monitor.ahk
- 🗑️ Removed save for trade feature (not suitable for reroll groups)
- 🤖 Alias Generator for botting account usernames
- ⚠️ Low Pack Per Hours Alert via Webhook
- 🧪 [Beta] Account generation only mode - only works for 5 pack fast method.

## **__TODO__**
